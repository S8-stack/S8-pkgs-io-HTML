	<h1><b>X509</b> Certificates and Encodings</h1>
	<p>
		At its core an <b>X.509</b> certificate is a digital document that has
		been encoded and/or digitally signed according to RFC 5280. In fact,
		the term X.509 certificate usually refers to the IETF’s PKIX
		Certificate and CRL Profile of the X.509 v3 certificate standard, as
		specified in RFC 5280, commonly referred to as PKIX for Public Key
		Infrastructure (X.509).
	</p>

	<p>The first thing we have to understand is what each type of file
		extension is. There is a lot of confusion about what DER, PEM, CRT,
		and CER are and many have incorrectly said that they are all
		interchangeable. While in certain cases some can be interchanged the
		best practice is to identify how your certificate is encoded and then
		label it correctly. Correctly labeled certificates will be much easier
		to manipulate.</p>
	<h2>Encodings (also used as extensions)</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><b>.DER</b> = The DER extension is used for binary DER
			encoded certificates. These files may also bear the CER or the CRT
			extension. Proper English usage would be “I have a DER encoded
			certificate” not “I have a DER certificate”.</li>
		<li><b>.PEM</b> = The PEM extension is used for different types
			of X.509v3 files which contain ASCII (Base64) armored data prefixed
			with a “—– BEGIN …” line.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Common Extensions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>.CRT</b> = The CRT extension is used for certificates. The
			certificates may be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM. The CER
			and CRT extensions are nearly synonymous. Most common among *nix
			systems</li>
		<li><b>.CER</b> = alternate form of .crt (Microsoft Convention)
			You can use MS to convert .crt to .cer (.both DER encoded .cer, or
			base64[PEM] encoded .cer) The .cer file extension is also recognized
			by IE as a command to run a MS cryptoAPI command (specifically
			rundll32.exe cryptext.dll,CryptExtOpenCER) which displays a dialogue
			for importing and/or viewing certificate contents.
		<li><b>.KEY</b> = The KEY extension is used both for public and
			private PKCS#8 keys. The keys may be encoded as binary DER or as
			ASCII PEM.
	</ul>
	<p>The only time CRT and CER can safely be interchanged is when the
		encoding type can be identical. (ie PEM encoded CRT = PEM encoded CER)
	</p>
	<h2>Standard X.509 <b>v3</b> Certificate Extension Reference</h2>
	<p>An <b>X.509 v3</b> certificate contains an extension field that permits
		any number of additional fields to be added to the certificate.
		Certificate extensions provide a way of adding information such as
		alternative subject names and usage restrictions to certificates.</p>

	<h1><b>PKCS#12</b> format</h1>
	<p>
		In cryptography, <b>PKCS #12</b> defines an <b>archive file format</b>
		for storing many cryptography objects as a single file. It is commonly
		used to bundle a <b>private key</b> with its <b>X.509 certificate</b>
		or to bundle all the members of a chain of trust. A PKCS #12 file may
		be encrypted and signed. PKCS #12 is one of the family of standards
		called Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) published by RSA
		Laboratories.
	</p>
	<p>The filename extension for PKCS #12 files is ".p12" or
		".pfx".[3]</p>
	<p>The internal storage containers, called "SafeBags", may also be
		encrypted and signed. A few SafeBags are predefined to store
		certificates, private keys and CRLs. Another SafeBag is provided to
		store any other data at individual implementer's choice.[1][2]</p>

	<h1>SSL tools</h1>
	<h2>OpenSSL</h2>
	<p>OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL and TLS
		protocols. It provides an encryption transport layer on top of the
		normal communications layer, allowing it to be intertwined with many
		network applications and services. The default SSL Profile in the
		Cloud Management Console has a generic Common Name. When associating
		an SSL profile to a Gateway Cluster, if using the default SSL Profile,
		your application making API calls may fail to verify the host name it
		is connecting to against the certificate presented. In this case, you
		can generate a new self-signed certificate that represents a Common
		Name your application can validate. This topic tells you how to
		generate self-signed SSL certificate requests using the OpenSSL
		toolkit to enable HTTPS connections.</p>
	<h2>KeyTool</h2>
	<p>keytool is a key and certificate management utility. It allows
		users to administer their own public/private key pairs and associated
		certificates for use in self-authentication (where the user
		authenticates himself/herself to other users/services) or data
		integrity and authentication services, using digital signatures. It
		also allows users to cache the public keys (in the form of
		certificates) of their communicating peers. A certificate is a
		digitally signed statement from one entity (person, company, etc.),
		saying that the public key (and some other information) of some other
		entity has a particular value. (See Certificates.) When data is
		digitally signed, the signature can be verified to check the data
		integrity and authenticity. Integrity means that the data has not been
		modified or tampered with, and authenticity means the data indeed
		comes from whoever claims to have created and signed it.</p>

		1. Suppose you have a certificate and key in PEM format. The key is
		named
		<code>host.key</code>
		and the certificate
		<code>host.crt</code>
		.
	</p>
	<p>2. The first step is to convert them into a single PKCS12 file
		using the command:</p>
	<div class="code-box">openssl pkcs12 -export -in host.crt -inkey
		host.key > host.p12</div>
	<p>You will be asked for various passwords (the password to access
		the key (if set) and then the password for the PKCS12 file being
		created).</p>
	<p>3. Then import the PKCS12 file into a keystore using the
		command:</p>
	<div class="code-box">keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore
		host.p12 -destkeystore host.jks -srcstoretype pkcs12</div>
	<p>You now have a keystore named host.jks containing the
		certificate/key you need. For the sake of completeness here's the
		output of a full session I performed: $ openssl pkcs12 -export -in
		host.crt -inkey host.key > host.p12 Enter pass phrase for host.key:
		Enter Export Password: Verifying - Enter Export Password: $ keytool
		-importkeystore -srckeystore host.p12 -destkeystore host.jks
		-srcstoretype pkcs12 Enter destination keystore password: Re-enter new
		password: Enter source keystore password: Entry for alias 1
		successfully imported. Import command completed: 1 entries
		successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled</p>
